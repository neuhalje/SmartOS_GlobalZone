CHANGELOG
=========
20110513 ver 0.9.9
           -Fixed a small but showstopping bug in Solaris that wasn't showing
	     up in FreeBSD. Thanks predrag....@googlemail.com. Because this
	     is the only fix and is not affecting FreeBSD, I may not update
	     the port until the next version.
20110510 ver 0.9.8
           -Added -c option to default rsync options list. Note that this
	     much increases reliability of backups, at the expense of speed.
	   -Removed --del option when transferring single files with -N.
           -Fixed bug in rsync transfer, where --del option caused
	     attempted deletes of filesystem mountpoints on destination.
           -Made the grandfather protection option check everything BEFORE
	     any deletions would occur. If grandfathers are being deleted,
	     chances are something is wrong, so better to fail before doing
	     damage.
	   -Added a "p" switch to persist in face of rsync errors. Needed
	     for a full system restore.
	   -Added an "E" to enable passing of excludes to rsync (useful
	     for avoiding transfer of zpool.cache)
	   -Added an "i" option to enable inclusion of filesystem mountpoints
	     on the destination in -S mode, as they needed to be excluded
	     by default.
	     If they aren't excluded then --del will wipe anything there,
	     e.g. contents from a filesystem from another pool.
20110407 ver 0.9.7
           -Removed the extra backup related content from the man page
             as more suitable for external documentation. KISS.
	   -Added in a "grandfather protection" option [-g], to prevent
	     grandfather snapshots being deleted inadvertently.
20110405   -Again, added to and modified the man page significantly, to
              explain tape vs HDD backup.
20110404   -Made zxfer more portable, by testing for the actual $PATH via
             "which" instead of guessing which directories the programs might
	     live in.
20110402 ver 0.9.6
           -Added a section "SNAPSHOTS" to the man page, to express that
             zxfer is designed to work with snapshots, and how it does so.
	   -Made zxfer use awk in FreeBSD, gawk in Solaris, so that there
	     is only the rsync dependency remaining for purpose of porting.
20110331 ver 0.9.5
           -Changed download package to have a directory within, to suit ports.
20110331 ver 0.9.4
           -Some refactoring, updating man page, and testing to make
             it work better on S11E.
20110329 ver 0.9.3
           -Tested local transfers on FBSD 8.2 and SE11. Tested remote
             transfers on FBSD 8.2.
	   -Updated the man page.
20110328   -Implemented the -O and -T remote transfer options. Tested on
             FreeBSD somewhat.
20110327 ver 0.9.2  
           -Added "Compatibility" section to man page.
           -Added to the man page a warning not to tack switches with arguments
             on the end of a list of switches without arguments.
	   -Alphabetized the options in the man page, and in the script.
20110323   -Started fixing a bug so that zxfer can work with remote hosts via 
             ssh.
	   -Added "vscan,nbmand" to the list of properties not supported
	     by FreeBSD.
20110321   -Added "xattr" to list of properties not supported on FreeBSD,
             so that zxfer works on FreeBSD 8.2 out of the box.
	   -Changed the beep option, breaking backwards compatibility for
	     the sake of having more logical switches. The B is a "big beep",
	     alerting the user for success or failure. The b is a "small beep"
	     that will only sound on error.
20101211 ver 0.9.0 -Added some output for errors.
           -Added proviso to man page about backing up/restoring FreeBSD
	     root directories.
           -Familiarized self with mercurial workflow in anticipation of
	     publishing.
           -Fixed several Solaris compatibility bugs.
           -Added /usr/bin as rsync location
	   -Changed awk to gawk
	   -mlslabel transferring is not supported at this stage.
	   -ditto for keysource,keystatus,rekeydate,encryption.
	   -OpenSolaris wasn't handling 3 pipes in a single line, reduced
	    to maximum of 2 and it works.
20101127 ver 0.8.3 A week trialing zxfer on the workstation in active use
             pays off. Not all snapshots were transferring with zfs send
	     based zxfers. Needless to say, very glad it's squashed.
	   -Also added a beep (-b) feature, to alert when zxfer finishes.
	   -Finished tweaking and testing the man page for easy conversion
	     to Solaris format (using mdoc2man.awk).
20101117 ver 0.8.2 Nearly ready, just needs Solaris man page.
           -Location of rsync is searched for at the start.
20101115 ver 0.8.1 Ready to release?
           -Finished testing on all of the examples in the man page.
           -Added the ability to specify snapshots to use as a base
	     for rsync (option "u").
	   -Changed the default rsync options (see man page).
20101013 ver 0.8.0 First "near final" draft sent to Constantin.
           In the intervening time, many changes have taken place. 
	   zxfer is chosen as the new name. Some of the additional features:
	   -recursive transfers
	   -property and property source transfer of ZFS filesystems - 
	     creation and setting
	   -property overrides (e.g. for compression, dedup, copies etc.)
	   -an rsync mode, for copying arbitrary files and directories 
	     from within a pool atomically
	   -property backup mode, to allow the future restore of properties
	     while retaining the ability to back them up with different
	     properties than they would otherwise have, e.g. compression etc.
	   -removed the ksh dependency
	   -a man page
	   -much bug testing
20100504 Dreckman worked on a bug fix and some additions to
           zfs-replicate; these are submitted to CG. At this stage
	   the additions are already fairly extensive, so Contantin kindly 
	   suggested that the new version become a new utility in its 
	   own right. Collaboration commenced between the two with 
	   Constantin offering helpful guidance throughout as Dreckman coded
	   new features and squashed bugs.
20080813 zfs-replicate 0.7 is released by Constantin Gonzalez as the
           last update in his zfs-replicate utility. This may be found at
